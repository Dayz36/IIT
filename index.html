            <H1>Interest in IT</H1>
            <article>
    <p>My interest in I.T started at a young age, constantly fighting with my brothers for access to the computer… It was just for basic childish things at that point (mostly playing games).
    <p>It was not until I had finished school and started working when I had obtained my first computer that I could call my own, but I still always had technology around be it phone, social media etc. 
    <p>Eventually I had decided one day that I wanted to build my own system where I realized the potential for a career as some of my more technical friends had no idea how to build the machine nor the willingness to watch a few YouTube video’s.
    <p>I then found myself completing the IT degree offered by NSW TAFE’s. Not long after this I landed my first job, and I was suddenly hooked on everything I.T the more I seemed to learn the less I knew… I find myself constantly looking around into all the different area’s I.T has to offer and not being able to choose anything. My strong interest at this point would be somewhere between a systems/network engineer. I feel this caters more to somebody who has not specialized in one specific area and instead has knowledge within multiple areas to do what the company requires.
