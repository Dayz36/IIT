          <H1>Interest in IT</H1>
            <article>
              <p>My interest in I.T started at a young age, constantly fighting with my brothers for access to the computer… It was just for basic childish things at that point (mostly playing games).
              <p>It was not until I had finished school and started working when I had obtained my first computer that I could call my own, but I still always had technology around be it phone, social media etc.
              <p>Eventually I had decided one day that I wanted to build my own system where I realized the potential for a career as some of my more technical friends had no idea how to build the machine nor the willingness to watch a few YouTube video’s.
              <p>I then found myself completing the IT degree offered by NSW TAFE’s. Not long after this I landed my first job, and I was suddenly hooked on everything I.T the more I seemed to learn the less I knew… I find myself constantly looking around into all the different area’s I.T has to offer and not being able to choose anything. My strong interest at this point would be somewhere between a systems/network engineer. I feel this caters more to somebody who has not specialized in one specific area and instead has knowledge within multiple areas to do what the company requires.
              <p>I chose to come to RMIT as I plan to move to Melbourne eventually. Later on as the program becomes more challenging I would like to move to an in class student. 
              <P>I expect to learn alot of skills that I have brushed over from working in the field. From working in the field you generally pick up and learn about the things that heavily influence the company that you work for.

          <h1> Project Idea </h1>
          <h1>TBC (NAME)</h1>
            <article>
              <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>I will create a smartphone app that will generate recipes based off categories that you select. They will then compile the ingredients for the recipes into a shopping list. You will not be able to select specific recipes as the whole idea is to increase your knowledge of what you know how to cook so you are not stuck cooking the same 10 recipes for ever.
              <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>Have you ever ordered one of those services that deliver to your door? The groceries have been just garbage like not even fresh. With this app you will pick the purchase the produce yourself, so you know how fresh it is. As a chef I have so many receipes stored up, the trouble my household faces is picking one of the recipes. This will remove that decision saving many of arguments!
              <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>So far all I have is that you will pick meals based on categories, that have yet to be decided as to what categories will be available, if it is decided on region or comfort, but it will be multiple choice, 5 pop ups with choices of three that are randomly generated.
                <p>In this list I will have 5 choices per category, that again will be thrown into a RNG as to what recipes you end up with. It will then store quantities of the amounts into a list and display that on the screen for you to go shopping for.
                <p>Then when you go to cook it the recipe method will be stored somewhere on the app. Open it up and get to cooking!
                <p>There might be a save function where you can store your faviourite receipes that you come across in a seperate part of the app so that you can whip them out where ever you are. This is mainly so you could show others the receipes that the app has given you and maybe cook them when you are out with friends. This would be a nice feature due to free advertising and marketing when the consumer will show it to their peers.
              <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                <p>I am hoping just a standard mobile smartphone… I may use MIT App Inventor at this point I am not sure. Maybe a database depending on how large it all gets…
              <h2>Skills Required</h2>
                <p>Will need strong coding experience. As well as strong research skills to find the recipes.
              <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p> if this project is successful, I will have a cool way to store my own recipes that’s unique?
