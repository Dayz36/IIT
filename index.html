        <div class="sectionTitle"><H1>Interest in IT</H1></div class="sectionTitle">
            <article>
              <p> My interest in I.T started at a young age, constantly fighting with my brothers for access to the computer… It was just for basic childish things at that point (mostly playing games).
              <p>It was not until I had finished school and started working when I had obtained my first computer that I could call my own, but I still always had technology around be it phone, social media etc.
              <p>Eventually I had decided one day that I wanted to build my own system where I realized the potential for a career as some of my more technical friends had no idea how to build the machine nor the willingness to watch a few YouTube video’s.
              <p>I then found myself completing the IT degree offered by NSW TAFE’s. Not long after this I landed my first job, and I was suddenly hooked on everything I.T the more I seemed to learn the less I knew… I find myself constantly looking around into all the different area’s I.T has to offer and not being able to choose anything. My strong interest at this point would be somewhere between a systems/network engineer. I feel this caters more to somebody who has not specialized in one specific area and instead has knowledge within multiple areas to do what the company requires.
              <p>I chose to study at RMIT because I have been thinking of moving to Melbourne and I would love to turn into an in-class student, during the earlier stages I thought it would be ok to remotely study.
              <p>I expect to learn a lot about the different pathways within IT. Working in the industry I seem to just experience events that would help build my helpdesk roll (Well duh, that is what I am employed for). I have chosen the generalized IT degree to help broaden my horizons and narrow down what I would like to do.

					             <p>These test results actually hit really close to home, I found them to be pretty accurate. In the 16 personality test it has something I pride myself on and thats my willingness to learn. Well except for the Big 5 personality test, but I have a feeling that triggers quite alot of people...
					             <p>I will answer both of the next parts within the same answer... I dont think these results will influence my baviour in a team at all. Part of working in teams is that you dont get choose who you want to work with. You get paired with people and you have to make the best of it. I know what my strengths and weakness's are and what I can do to work with everybody to get the best result for the team. Forming a team is building on one persons strengths and adding other people with different strengths to get the best result.

          <div class="sectionTitle"><h1> Project Idea </h1></div class="sectionTitle">
          <h2>Cooked Fresh</h2>
            <article>
              <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>I will create an app that will generate recipes based off categories that you select. They will then compile the ingredients for the recipes into a shopping list. You will not be able to select specific recipes as the whole idea is to increase your knowledge of what you know how to cook so you are not stuck cooking the same 10 recipes for ever.
              <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>Have you ever ordered one of those services that deliver to your door? The groceries have been just garbage like not even fresh. With this app you will pick the purchase the produce yourself, so you know how fresh it is. As a chef I have so many receipes stored up, the trouble my household faces is picking one of the recipes. This will remove that decision saving many of arguments!
              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>So having fresh food is seriously what makes most of the restaurant’s food so yummy. What makes this so impractical to do on a day-to-day basis is figuring out what you must do and get the shopping lists together. With this app it does all the groundwork of hunting the recipes down and compiling the ingredients into a shopping list.
              <p>It will be an app where you will pick meals based on categories, it is not recommended you do more than three as the whole idea is, we are using fresh produce. Once you have decided what categories you select the list will be generated based off a stack of recipes that I have compiled into those categories, these categories will be based on a whole bunch of different factors for example you can select food based on region or comfort or maybe your feeling fancy (Fine dining). These choices will be multiple choice so you will not get free reign of what you wish to pick, this is hopefully to make people kind of explore with their foods, otherwise you will get stuck cooking the same recipes.
              <p>Once you buy the ingredients you can then come back and select the recipe when you wish to cook it. With a method popping up in easy-to-follow text. (maybe pictures? I am a bit daunted by the code side of things)
              <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
                <p>I am hoping just a standard mobile smartphone… I may use MIT App Inventor at this point I am not sure. I would love to write this myself, but I do not think I am at that level yet. It is doubtful that I will need a database at this point, but as this is the technology the project may require this is something that may be needed.
              <h2>Skills Required</h2>
                <p>Will need strong coding experience. As well as strong research skills to find the recipes, Strong writing skills to be able to put it into text that is easily read and followed.
              <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>If this project is successful it will just be a way to store recipes that generate on a random loop for myself at this point… I’m over cooking the same things over and over again.
